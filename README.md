<h1>Assessment 1</h1>
<h4>Per-Question Explanations:</h4>

<h4>1. What is the purpose of the query?</h4>
The query is designed to report summary information per user about their involvement in savings and investment plans.
It calculates:

Total number of regular savings accounts.

Total number of investment accounts (referred to as "funds").

Total confirmed deposit amount across these accounts.

2. <h4>Why were certain joins used?</h4>
The JOIN between users_customuser and savings_savingsaccount links each user to their savings accounts.

The JOIN between savings_savingsaccount and plans_plan associates each account with the corresponding plan type, needed to distinguish between savings and investment accounts.

3. <h4>Why include the WHERE clause on plan types?</h4>
To focus the analysis only on users who have either savings or investment accounts (excluding accounts of other plan types that may exist).

4.<h4> What’s the role of GROUP BY?</h4>
GROUP BY ensures aggregation happens per user (identified by owner_id), and also breaks down the totals based on the CASE condition — though this specific part could be optimized.

 <h1>Challenges:</h1>

Grouping by CASE Expression:

Issue: The query uses a CASE statement in the GROUP BY clause that is not referenced in the SELECT clause. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors depending on the SQL dialect.

Resolution: Removed the CASE from GROUP BY to just group by the user fields (owner_id, first_name, last_name), as that is sufficient for the aggregations required.

Ambiguity in Plan Classification:

Issue: It was not clear if a single plan could be both a regular savings and an investment fund. If so, this could lead to double-counting.

Resolution: Assumed mutual exclusivity of plan types. If that’s not the case, additional clarification or logic would be required.

Optimization Concern:

Issue: Multiple joins and aggregations could affect performance on large datasets.

Resolution: Indexing on plan_id, owner_id, and confirmed_amount fields would help. Additionally, a CTE or subquery could simplify or improve readability and modularity.

Let me know if you'd like a revised version of the SQL with these improvements or written as a report.
